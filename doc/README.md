Zetacoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Zetacoin Core connects to the Zetacoin peer-to-peer network to download and fully validate blocks and transactions. The full blockchain requires approximately 10 GB of disk space (with compression). Synchronization from genesis takes several hours due to the 18+ million blocks at 30-second intervals.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Zetacoin Core on your native platform.

### Unix / FreeBSD

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/zetacoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/zetacoind` (headless)
- `bin/zetacoin` (wrapper command)

The `zetacoin` command supports subcommands like `zetacoin gui`, `zetacoin node`, and `zetacoin rpc` exposing different functionality. Subcommands can be listed with `zetacoin help`.

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run zetacoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Zetacoin Core to your applications folder, and then run Zetacoin Core.
